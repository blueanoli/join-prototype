      personally identified. This privacy policy explains which data we collect and what we use it for. It also
      explains how, and for what purpose this happens.</span>
    <span>We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have

    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>General Information on the Legal Bases for Data Processing on This Website</h3>
    <span>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR
      or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR if special data categories pursuant to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR are processed. In case
      of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art.
      49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to access to information in your end
      device (e.g. via device fingerprinting), the processing is additionally based on ยง 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent

      GDPR. Data processing may also occur on the basis of our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f
      GDPR. The specific legal bases in each case are informed in the following paragraphs of this privacy
      policy.</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
    <span>In the course of our business activities, we cooperate with various external parties. This sometimes also
      requires the transmission of personal data to these external parties. We only pass on personal data to external
      parties if this is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g.,
      transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR in
      passing on the data or if another legal basis permits the data transfer. When using processors, we only pass on
      personal data of our customers based on a valid contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing,
      a contract for joint processing is concluded.</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
    <span>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke any previously
      given consent at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains
      unaffected by the revocation.</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Right to Object to the Collection of Data in Special Cases and Against Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
    <span>IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT TO
      THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
      PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH A PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN
      THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED UNLESS WE CAN
      DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS,
      OR IF THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART.
      21 PARA. 1 GDPR).</span>
    <span>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT
      ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO
      APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL
      DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21
      PARA. 2 GDPR).</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Right to Complain to the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
    <span>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
      authority, particularly in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the
      alleged infringement. This right of complaint exists irrespective of other administrative or judicial
      remedies.</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
    <span>You have the right to have data that we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract
      automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you request
      the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent technically
      feasible.</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Information, Correction and Deletion</h3>
    <span>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information
      about your stored personal data, their origin and recipient and the purpose of the data processing and, if
      necessary, a right to correction or deletion of these data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions
      on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.</span>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Right to Restrict Processing</h3>
    <span>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this, you can
      contact us at any time. The right to restrict processing applies in the following cases:</span>
    <ul>
      <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the
        duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
      </li>
      <li>If the processing of your personal data happened/happens unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data
        processing instead of deletion.</li>
      <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need them to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you
        have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
      <li>If you have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your
        interests and ours. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to
        request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
    </ul>
    <span>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data โ apart from their storage โ may
      only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the
      protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the
      European Union or a Member State.</span>

      you desire (e.g. for the shopping cart function) or to optimize the website (e.g. cookies to measure the web

      website operator has a legitimate interest in storing necessary cookies for the technically error-free and
      optimized provision of its services. If consent has been requested for the storage of cookies and similar
      recognition technologies, the processing is carried out exclusively based on this consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a
      GDPR and ยง 25 para. 1 TTDSG); consent can be revoked at any time.</span>
    <span>You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and allow cookies only on a
      case-by-case basis, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general, and activate the
      automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this
